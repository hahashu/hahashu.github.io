Millimetre-wave (mmWave) radar is cost-effective, non-intrusive and providing better protection for user privacy.

MilliPoints provides mmWave point cloud data and human skeleton models as ground truth:

- Covers three main tasks in human activity recognition.
- 49 distinct actions, 4.08x more than the most action-diverse mmWave dataset.
- 545K frames of data, 3.26x greater than the largest dataset in existence.
