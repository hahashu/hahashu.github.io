TextileBot is a domain-specific voice agent focused on the sustainability topic of textile circularityüß∂. IIt is built into a smart device, a Raspberry Pi encased in 3D-printed housing, and was introduced in February 2023.

#### From task-agnostic to domain-specific

- We proposed use Taxonomy-Based Knowledge Structure Chain to embed Textiles into the agent, enabling continuous multi-turn conversations.
