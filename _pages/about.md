I am a PhD candidate at the University College London's [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/research/research-labs/multi-sensory-devices) and [Interaction Centre (UCLIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic), supervised by [Marianna Obrist](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/78441-marianna-obrist), [Elia Gatti](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/93101-elia-gatti) and [Youngjun Cho](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/54637-youngjun-cho). 

Before my PhD journey, I worked in the aerospace industry✈️, where I designed and supervised the production of air turbine fan boosters and compressors—literally 🛫, not just a desk job!

My research focuses on AI for social good and domain-specific Human-Centered AI. I code 👩🏻‍💻, build prototypes, and explore Human-AI interaction, with a particular interest in integrating domain expertise into natural interactions. A key part of my PhD is to bring human-awareness to machine-awareness within the [UKRI Textile Circularity project](https://textilescircularity.rca.ac.uk/) 🧶. 

In addition, I serve as an [Athena Swan](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about/equity-diversity-and-inclusion/gender-equality-athena-swan) (gender equality) PhD Student Representative at CS UCL.
